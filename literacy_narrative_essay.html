        <p>
            Growing up, I learned two languages which shaped my approach to reading and learning. Although I wouldn't call myself a passionate reader or writer, I've come to appreciate the impact of language on my personal growth. In this essay, I'll share my journey of becoming bilingual and how it inspired me to explore unconventional reading styles.

            At home, my parents taught me English through books, while Spanish was our primary language. This bilingual environment sparked my curiosity for learning, even though I found traditional books uninteresting. To connect with literature, I ventured into graphic novels, picture books, and research papers, seeking a more engaging experience.
            
            These alternative formats transformed my reading journey. Graphic novels, with their visual elements, captivated me and improved my understanding. Articles provided concise and focused information, broadening my knowledge on various subjects.
            
            Through this exploration, I realized the significance of my bilingualism and early exposure to literature. Embracing non-traditional reading materials allowed me to engage with diverse topics in a visually stimulating way.
            
            My multilingualism not only facilitated communication with people from different backgrounds but also nurtured my appreciation for diversity and multiple perspectives. It played a crucial role in my personal and professional life, creating unique opportunities and stronger relationships.
            
            Looking back, I'm grateful for my parents' support in fostering my love for reading. Their influence, coupled with my bilingual upbringing, shaped my work ethic and curiosity.
            
            My literacy journey has taught me the importance of adaptability and embracing different approaches to learning. Each person's path to literacy is unique and valuable. By appreciating our differences and remaining open to new experiences, we can create a more inclusive society.
            
            This essay aims to share my experience of navigating two languages and embracing unconventional reading styles. I hope it inspires others to embrace their own unique paths to literacy, regardless of any challenges they may encounter. By seeking opportunities to learn and grow, we can foster personal development and connect with others on a deeper level.

              <em>Rough Draft Excerpt:</em>
              <br>
              My parents actively worked to teach me both languages because they recognized the benefits of being bilingual. While at home, we only spoke Spanish, they taught me English through books. Throughout my school years, this method completely immersed me in English and helped me to link reading in the language to learning. My thoughts and daily life at home continued to be in Spanish during this time. I was able to appreciate the beauty and complexity of each language while simultaneously being exposed to them, and it taught me the value of adjusting to various cultural contexts.
